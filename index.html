                Web Developer, Art Director, Graphic Designer, and Artist residing Dallas, Texas. I graduated from Texas Christian University in Fort Worth Texas with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2010. My work derives from found objects, DIY aesthetic, trash art, and creative collaboration, which is relevant within my design and web projects. I am currently enrolled in an intensive Web Development Bootcamp at Southern Methodist University.

                My passion for numbers, design, and order is what brought me to expand my knowledge of Web Development. My first experience within this field was at the Dallas Contemporary. I started as a Graphic Designer, however quickly became in charge of the entire web presence of their brand. During this time, I taught myself how to code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. This was a monumental turning point in my desire to pursue Web Development. 
                <br><br>
                I have evolved and discovered over time that I am a wizard at any tech related issue, from troubleshooting to maintenance. My ultimate goal is to combine my design skills with Web Development to create user-focused, dynamic websites and applications.
